# Prefixes
Kobo dictionaries are sharded by a prefix derived from the headword.

**Note:** Kobo will only look in the file matching the word's prefix, so if a variant has a different prefix, it must be duplicated into each matching file (note that duplicate words aren't an issue).

TODO(v0): finish this page

## Testing
You can test Kobo's prefix algorithm using [dictword-test](https://github.com/geek1011/kobo-mods/tree/master/dictword-test/).
